Rust and GUI don't go together, at least traditional GUI libraries.

Currently plenty of rust libraries use browser techonologies, they also use DSLs, these end up being like mini-languages.

The motivation is surely there, it would have good performance, it would be lightweight by default, would have good type safety.

## Native API's
No! This just wouldn't be feasible,
