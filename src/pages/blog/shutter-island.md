Shutter island is of the most mind bending movies to ever be put out. We are going through the movie through the persepective of Ted, who is a U.S Marshal, investigating shutter island. An island that houses the criminally insane, however, Ted suspects some illegal things are hapenning here. We find out at the end of the movie, that Ted is actually Andrew Laedis, a patient of shutter island, who has been given one last attempt to get his sanity back. 

## The boat scene

## The storm
The storm is a pretty big part of the movie, it serves as a kind of cage for Andrew, making sure he does not leave the island. Throughout the movie we notice the storm wreaking havoc on the building and environment everywhere, however, in the very last scene we see no wreckage at all and the island is the same as it was when we just arrived. The storm also represents Andrew's fears of coming to terms with what he has done as he
avoids water all throughout the movie.
