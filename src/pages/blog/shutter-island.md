Shutter island is of the most mind-bending movies to ever be put out. We are going through the movie through the persepective of Ted, who is a U.S Marshal, investigating shutter island. An island that houses the criminally insane, however, Ted suspects some illegal things are hapenning here. We find out at the end of the movie, that Ted is actually Andrew Laedis, a patient of shutter island, who has been given one last attempt to get his sanity back. 

Throughout the movie we see Chuck glancing at Dr. ... it's like they know each other. In fact in most of the scenes
we can see that he's standing closer to Dr. ..., that he is to Teddy, his partner. We also see the both of them
smirking at Andrew when it appears he's making progress. In fact Chuck kind of just lays around the whole movie
not really doing too much, while Andrew is working.

## The boat scene

We're first introduced to Teddy/Andrew on a boat, throwing up in the bathroom because of his sea sickness. Water
reminds him of his dead children, and he tries to avoid it as much as possible throughout the movie. We also see
handcuffs as he walks out, suggesting that he has captive.

## Interrogation

Mrs. Kearns is first asked about Rachel, we see that she struggles to give a description because Rachel doesn't
actually exist. Just after that, when asked about Dr. Sheehan the first thing she does is glance at Chuck, as 
anyone would glance at a person when their name is mentioned.

When Mrs. Kearns goes to drink a glass of water we don't actually see anything in her hand when lifts her cup
up to drink.

But she actually does drink the water as when she puts the cup down it's empty.

Since we're in Teddy's perspective, he subconsciously ignores the water.
## The storm
The storm is used a device to keep Andrew in check, with his severe hydrophobia, he's unlikely to actually try to 
leave the island.

The storm is a pretty big part of the movie, it serves as a kind of cage for Andrew, making sure he does not leave the island. Throughout the movie we notice the storm wreaking havoc on the building and environment everywhere, however, in the very last scene we see no wreckage at all and the island is the same as it was when we just arrived. The storm also represents Andrew's fears of coming to terms with what he has done as he
avoids water all throughout the movie.



## George noyce

This scene is where the truth comes out plain and simple, it's thrown to both Teddy and the audience, but in your
first watch it's seen as confirming Teddys suspicions. As George is showing Teddy the scars on his face, Teddy 
asks him: "Who did this?" and he replies: "You did".

> Don't you get it? Everything you were up to, your whole plan. This is a game, all of this is for you.

George is trying to tell Teddy that all of this is fake, but to Teddy this is confirming his suspicions of the 
experiments that are going on this island. 

George actually knows Andrew and he knows this whole situation and is not a part of the game. He proceeds to tell
Andrew that the only way to leave the island is to let go of his dead wife.

## The cave scene
The cave scene is quite convincing, but it is a hallucination as well.
Before Teddy climbs down he sees Chuck dead at the sea bed, we know this isn't true because Chuck
appears again at the end of the movie. At the end of the movie Dr. ... reveals Teddy has been taken off his
usual drugs so this is where his hallucinations start getting really bad. After Teddy climbs down we see rats
coming out of a cave, another sign he is hallucinating. And when he finds Rachel in the cave, she literally
confirms every single thing Teddy was thinking.

## Return
When Teddy returns, in the background we see one of the staff members mutter "Stop looking at him".
